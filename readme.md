# VibeCast.world


Project Name - VibeCast.world


Description - VibeCast is a private live-streaming app that lets you talk on camera to curated groups of AI characters that react in real time.
Its main use case is acting as a personal mastermind—a space to brainstorm ideas, get sharp feedback, receive coaching, or pitch your startup to legendary thinkers like Balaji and the Network School core team.
You choose from predefined AI groups made up of tech and crypto pioneers, scholars, business entrepreneurs, artists, and fitness or mindset coaches.
Once live, your front-facing camera turns on and you speak naturally while the app captures audio transcription and periodic visual snapshots for context.
The AI audience watches, listens, and responds with thoughtful comments that feel like a focused, intelligent backchannel.
